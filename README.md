# Internet-Speed-Twitter-Complaint-Bot

In this Project I have used Selenium to automate a Bot which will automatically Test the Internet speed and After that  This Bot will Tweet a complaint against Internet ISP.

It wil compare download speed and our upload speed then compare these against what you were promised by your internet service provider. And then we're going to tweet at our provider to tell them about our terrible internet speeds compared to what we pay for

Because I was testing my code that's why I have not tag my ISP. You can also tag your ISP.
